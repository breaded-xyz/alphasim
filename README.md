Alphasim is a minimalist backtester inspired by <https://github.com/Robot-Wealth/rsims>.

The backtest input is the natural output of a typical quant research process: a dataframe of asset prices and weights.

Strategy performance is optimised using a _trade buffer_ heuristic.

If you're looking for a more traditional backtester and algo development platform (in Go) check out my other project <https://github.com/thecolngroup/alphakit>.
