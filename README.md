# Alphasim

!! Early alpha version - use at your own risk !!

Alphasim is a minimal backtester and python version of the excellent <https://github.com/Robot-Wealth/rsims>.

The inputs are the natural outputs of a typical quant research process: dataframes of asset prices and weights.

Trade costs are optimised using a the 'trade buffer' heuristic (see the rsims repo).

See the notebook in the vignettes directory for an example backtest of a classic 60/40 portfolio.

If you're looking for a more traditional backtester and algo development platform (in Go) check out my other project <https://github.com/thecolngroup/alphakit>
